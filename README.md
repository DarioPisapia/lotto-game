# Lotto Game
A replica of the Lotto game

This is my first full project. I did it during the learning path of TomorrowDevs.
It is a replica of the italian Lotto. Includes the possibility to create up to five tickets. 
Any of that has his type of bet, the numbers, the 'ruota' and the bet amount.
After that, the program extracts the numbers for every 'ruota' and check if there are winning tickets.
If there are, it proceds to calculate the win, either gross and net.
In this case the program shows to the player the winning tickets plus a ticket with the amount wins.
